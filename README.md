# __Responsive menu__
### __The goal__
To make a responsive menu that will load some HTML content.
### __Description__
In my work, I created a main menu, each element contains the name of the family of the lords of Westeros. Clicking on each menu item in the main menu will open a side menu with a list of lords from the selected family.
#### Example 1
![example](screenshots/example1.jpg 'menu')
If you select the appropriate lord from the list of lords, will be displayed text information with a picture about the selected lord.
#### Example 2

### __Using javascript__
Also in my project I'm using javascript to listen event "click", that assigns the active classes to display the selected information.
